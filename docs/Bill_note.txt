- Support:
-- Most in Scala, not really a lot of people using it Java
    - Support issue, like on stack over flow -> most are about scala
- Permance
    - on large system - brand new way of thinking - everything is in actor and message

- Documentation
    - user-friendly, but lack of concrete examples

- Plus of Akka
    - neat and clean api
    - Strategy is a plus
