Goal
====
Compare Actor base model with traditional java threading model and new fork join model in java 7
Concentrate on Java as we don't have enough time to learn another language1

Why Actor
When to/not to use Actor

Work Items
==========
- [Brilly] Computational intensive example - (Monte Carlo Simulation of options from Lecture 7)
    - code the single thread example
    - code the traditional example
    - code the actor based example
    - scalability analysis (different actor number)
    - demostrate it's event based?
    - http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/general/supervision.html <- need to re-read and test this out
- Create a fault tolerance scenario with memory leaking simulation as the lib leak memory model
- Slide Drafting
    - read the bullet train, jvm concurrency and wiki
    - summarize what is actor
    - from wiki, summarize actor horizon and language

Bonus
- Demonstrate tranparent remoting to have actors on two machines and working togehter? (win7 and OsX)
    - need to bring our own router?
- STM example with Transactors
- Actor in Erlang or Haskell?
